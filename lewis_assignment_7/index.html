    <h1>Welcome to The Lancaster Zoo</h1>
    <p id="p1">
      Welcome everybody to the Lancaster Zoo. With over 100 enclosures, on 200
      acres of land, you will have fun all day for the whole family. Whether you
      like to hear the roar of a lion, growl of a bear, or howl of a wolf, you
      will certainly have some special moments. We are open 365 days a year. We
      cater to individuals, and up to very large groups. We have on site free
      parking. We have indoor celebration facilities to rent for birthdays, and
      other special occasions. We were voted as the top attraction in
      Pennsylvania, and a top 5 zoo in the United States.
